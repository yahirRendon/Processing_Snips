<h1 align="center">Wiggle Square - Sine Easing</h1>

<p align="center">
  Not sure why this popped into my mind but thought this could be a fun GUI effect or perhaps game element. Use sine easing to oscillate/wiggle a square or line when clicked.  
</p>

## To Do
<p>- wiggle on collision
<br>- play with fill or color on hover/wiggle
</p>
 
## Demo
 <p>- Change the amplitude of the sine wave to increase wiggle
  <br>- Changing the speed creates illusion of the firmness of the square
  <br>- Line wiggle has a grow/shrink and wobble type
 </p>

</p>

##  Instructions
<p>
  - click on an object to see the wiggle.
  <br>- play with the parameters to see the effect
</p>

## Usage Notes
<p>- Processing 3.5.4
<br>- Ensure the .pde file is contained within a folder of the exact same name
